# Unit 3 Planning 

#Generate rational functions 

#TODO: Generate any rational function ie. functions with no asymptotes, functions with horzontal asymptote, etc

#TODO: Generate quadractic rational functions 

#TODO: Generate rational function with asymptotes so we just need to have the denominator be a factorable polynomial

#TODO: Generate rational function that has one as the numerator and the deonominator be a simple factorable polynomial for questions asking about what the asymptotes are 

#TODO: Intervals where function is positive ornegative 

#TODO: Intercepts of rational function ie. when the numerator = 0. 

#TODO: Domain and range of rational function 

#TODO: graph of rational function 

#TODO: Intervals where the function is increasing/decreasing ie. where the deriviative is above zero and below zero

#TODO: The vertical asympotes of a rational function 

#TODO: The horizonal asympotes of a rational function. Ex. As x-> infinity or x->-infinity y->above 0 or below 0 

#TODO: The y-intercept, and x-intercepts of a rational function 

#TODO: important attributes of rational functions (for graphing questions), ie. x-int, y-int, HA, VA, 

#TODO: Generate quotient of linear functions 

#TODO: Generate spceial case function: A function with holes 

#TODO: Generate a rational fucnction with a oblique asymptote. CASE 1. A quadractic over a linear 

#TODO: Generate a rational fucnction with a oblique asymptote. CASE 2. A higher order function over a higher ordeer fucntion
# Have to solve where the function intersects the HA to graph 

#TODO: Inequalities of rational functions 

#TODO: Solving rational equations
